Author: Logapriyah  
Date: 28 October  
Location: UTM Digital (with Faculty of Computing)

## Summary
I had a great learning experience during our visit to UTM Digital on 28th October with the Faculty of Computing. The visit provided meaningful exposure to how digital technologies, data engineering, and IT infrastructure are applied in a real-life working environment at UTM. It strengthened my interest in computing and motivated me to keep exploring how digital technology can solve real-world problems.

## Purpose
- To observe how a digital innovation centre operates.
- To learn which industry tools and technologies are used in production environments.
- To connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications.

## Highlights
- Guided tours of UTM Digital facilities and infrastructure.
- Demonstrations of digital systems that support efficient operations and informed decision-making.
- Multiple company booths (including HP) showcasing industry tools and current technology trends.
- Opportunities to ask questions and learn about practical workflows and engineering practices.

## Key Technologies & Topics Observed
- Data engineering workflows (data pipelines, storage, and processing ideas)
- IT infrastructure and systems that support day-to-day operations
- Industry tools demonstrated at partner booths (e.g., HP hardware and solutions)
- Trends in digital transformation and enterprise tooling

## What I Learned
- How digital components (data, infrastructure, tools) integrate to support organizational goals.
- Real-world constraints and design considerations that influence system design and operations.
- Practical examples of technologies and vendor solutions used in industry settings.
- The importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration between engineering, operations, and stakeholders.

## Takeaways
- The visit reinforced my interest in computing and motivated me to deepen my knowledge in data engineering and IT infrastructure.
- Seeing real deployments helped me connect theoretical knowledge from coursework to practical implementation.
- I want to explore more hands-on projects and internships that involve system design and data-driven decision-making.

## Next Steps (Personal)
- Follow up on specific technologies and tools introduced during the visit (create mini-projects or tutorials).
- Read case studies or documentation from companies and teams showcased at the event.
- Look for internship or volunteer opportunities to gain practical experience.
